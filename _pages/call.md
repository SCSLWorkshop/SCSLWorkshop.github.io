Over the last decade, deep learning has brought about astonishing improvements in computer vision, signal processing, language modeling and beyond.
The complexity of real high-dimensional data and deep network architectures used in practice stands as a challenge to traditional mathematical analysis, which is limited to simplified, tractable models that can be analyzed rigorously from the bottom up.
Hence, many aspects remain mysterious and our understanding of the success and failure modes of deep learning remains very limited.

This workshop aims to promote a complementary approach to further our understanding of deep learning, through the lens of the scientific method. This approach uses carefully designed experiments in order to answer precise questions about how and why deep learning works.
For instance, it can be used to validate or falsify hypotheses, challenge common assumptions, evidence surprising phenomena, or reveal empirical regularities. Such results can then be used to ground theoretical models in empirical observations or formulate conjectures, but also
can inform engineering decisions and spur new research directions.

## Topics

We invite researchers from machine learning and related fields to submit their latest work on the science of deep learning to the workshop. We encourage submissions related (but not limited) to the following topics:

_Coming soon!_

We welcome studies that fall outside standard acceptance criteria (such as improving state-of-the-art performance or proving rigorous theorems), yet have a high impact potential to further our understanding of deep learning.

## Important Dates

*   Submission Deadline: _Coming soon!_
*   Acceptance Notification: _Coming soon!_
<!-- *   Camera-Ready Deadline for Accepted Submissions: `TBD` -->

## Submission Details

To ensure your submission is considered, please adhere to the following guidelines:

* **Formatting Instructions**: _Coming soon!_
*   **Reviews**: The review process will be double-blind. All **submissions must be anonymized** and the leakage of any identification information is prohibited.
*   **Dual Submission Policy**: If the submission was accepted at prior conferences, journal, or workshops (including Neurips 2024), it should be extended to be considered for acceptance at our workshop. Papers that are currently under review are welcome to be submitted to our workshop.
*   If your paper is accepted it will not appear in any proceedings, journal, or book. We will post the list of accepted papers on the workshop website.
